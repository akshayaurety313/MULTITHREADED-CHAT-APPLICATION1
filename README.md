Introduction

A Multithreaded Chat Application is a network-based software system designed to allow multiple users to communicate with each other simultaneously. Unlike single-threaded applications, where only one request can be handled at a time, a multithreaded approach enables the server to manage multiple clients concurrently by creating a separate thread for each user connection. This ensures faster communication, real-time message delivery, and efficient utilization of system resources.

The application typically follows a client-server architecture, where:

The server runs continuously, listens for incoming client requests, and assigns a dedicated thread to handle each client.

The clients can connect to the server, send messages, and receive responses in real time.

This project demonstrates key concepts of socket programming, multithreading, and concurrent communication in computer networks. It provides a practical foundation for real-world applications such as chat rooms, instant messaging services, and collaborative platforms.
